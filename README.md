Arduino esp8266 plasma anim for 16x16 ws28212 LED Module.

I something like this board [https://aliexpress.com/item/4000183282756.html]

Just connect GND form NodeMCU to GND and D1 (Pin 5) to DataIn (green) to the LED Module.

Also connect 5V and GND to the LED Module from a high current power supply.

The code is a optimized version of the nebelborg code from [https://wiki.das-labor.org/w/Nebel_Borg].
